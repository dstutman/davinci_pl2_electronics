Questions, Answers, and Comments
================================

n. Question or comment
| Additional from author

1. JTAG current limiting
> Place before current limiting.

2. Capacitor to ground on reset
> (AN2519) Retain capacitor if not using DebugWIRE or PDI

3. I2C bus isolator
| Other slaves on bus are not protected in any way. Are rad hard isolators easy for us to acquire?

4. UART series resistors
> UART only in use for devboard

5. OBC not rad-hard, has implications for watchdog
| Is it still necessary to include an additional external rad-hard watchdog on board considering internal watchdog?

6. Devboard LDO not rad-hard
> Only for USB power to devboard, not on actual payload

7. NPN instead of PNP switch to bank power bus
> Designer error

8. Memory power limiting resistors
> Will be implemented

9. Power via input lines and IO bus
| Asked Dr. Puchner (Cypress), may be issue
| Should independent switching of each bus be eliminated considering additional complexity in favor of payload wide control?
| Can we easily source a radiation hard line driver for each bank, or a mux?
